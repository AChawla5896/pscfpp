PSCF is a library of C++ classes and programs for solving the Edwards-Helfand self-consistent for polymer liquids. It is not yet complete or functional, but is intended to eventualy replace the existing Fortran program of the same name. When complete, the package will contain a pseudo-spectral implementation for periodic structures, analagous to the existing Fortran code, as well as a simpler one-dimensional finite difference implementation for studying problems that involve only a single spatial coordinate in Cartesian, cylindrical or spherical coordinates (i.e., brushes, interfaces, and cylindrical or circular micelles).

This C++ version of PSCF is free, open source software.
