The following table shows a list of available commands for the pscf_pcNd 
CPU programs for N-dimensionally periodic microstructures (i.e., pscf_pc1d,
pscf_pc2d, and pscf_pc3d). Unless otherwise stated, commands that read or 
write chemical potential (w) fields or monomer volume fraction (c) fields 
use a file format in which the field associated with each monomer type 
is specified by giving Fourier coefficients of that field in a 
symmetry-adapted Fourier exapnsion. This file format is identical to 
the default file format used by the Fortran PSCF program.
