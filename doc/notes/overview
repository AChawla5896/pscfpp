Chemistry
---------

    These classes are used to describe molecular structures

    Monomer
    Vertex
    BlockDescriptor
    Species
    PolymerTmpl<Block> : public Species
    SolventDescriptor : public Species
    
Each Monomer, Vertex, Block, and PolymerTmpl<Block> has an id that
corresponds to the array index in any array of such structures. A 
bond has the ids of the vertices to which it is attached and the id 
of the associated monomer type. A vertex has the ids of the bonds 
to which it is attached. 

Each PolymerTmpl<Block> and SolventDescriptor also contains the
ensemble (Open or Closed) and the volume fraction phi or chemical
potential mu of the species. These variables are protected members
of the Species base class.

Fields
------

   class Field
   class WField : public WField
   class QField : public Qield
   class CField : public CField

   Base on DArray<double> (derived or copy and paste)
   Provide methods or global functions:

      1) Pointwise multiplication of fields, operator *=
      1) Addition of fields, operator +=
      2) Inner product: Functor with two fields as arguments.

SCF Solvers (General)
---------------------

   Each implementation (one-dimensional finite element, psuedo
spectral, etc) has a set of MDE solver classes that also contain
chemical information.  The solvers class system is based in
part on C++ templates, rather than run time polymorphism alone.

   class Propagator : publiic PropagatorTmpl<Propagator>
      Has q(r,s) data structure, pointers to Block.

   class Block : public BlockTmpl<Propagator>
      one per block, derived from BlockDescriptor
      Has data structures used to compute both propagators for 
      one block in both directions, including ns_, ds_ and arrays.

   class Polymer : public PolymerTmpl<Block>
      Has arrays of Block and Vertex objects

   class Solvent : public SolventDescriptor
      Implements a simple Boltzmann solver for a point particle.

   class Mixture : public MixtureTmpl<Polymer, Solvent>
      Has arrays of Monomer, Polymer, Solvent objects
      Has arrays of WField and CFields 

1D Finite Difference
--------------------

   For 1D finite difference:

   namespace Scf {
   namespace Fd1d 
   {
      System {
         Mixture
         Iterator
      }
   }
   }

   For pseuddospectroal, periodic with symmetry constraints:

Pseudospectral, periodic
------------------------

   namespace Scf {
   namespace PsSp {
      System {
         Mixture
         Interaction (chi parameters)
         UnitCell
         SpaceGroup
         Basis
         Iterator
      }
   }
   }

   Questions / comments about periodic pseudospectral code:

   1) Basis must provide methods to convert basisToGrid and gridToBasis.
   Where will the basis representation be stored? In the field object?
   If so, these functions could take one Field as an argument and update
   one of the two representations.

   2) How to handle different dimensions in C++ ? It would be nice to 
   have only code, even if it needed to be recompiled. 

      - The simplest solution would be to use a preprocessor macro. 
        This, however, would make it impossible to have different
        objects with different dimensions in the same code.

      - The most flexible, but messier, solution would be to make all
        relevant class templates in terms of Dimension.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   General Questions:
   1) Should wFields_ be a member of the Mixture, or the main System?
   2) Should cFields_ be a member of the Mixture, or the main System?
   3) What interface is required for the Interaction class?

   Remarks:

   1) Making Wfields_ and cFields_ members of the System yields an 
   increase in flexibility for Newton-Raphson style iterators with 
   no loss of speed.

   2) A preprocessor macro for dimension could help. Define a grid
   position class that can be passed to an accessor?
