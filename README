PSCF++ is a library of C++ classes and programs for solving the 
Edwards-Helfand self-consistent for polymer liquids. It is still under 
development, but is intended to eventually replace the existing 
PSCF Fortran program.  When complete, the package will contain a 
pseudo-spectral implementation for periodic structures, analagous to 
the existing Fortran code, as well as specialized implementations for 
other geometries and boundary conditons. 

Some differences in design relative to the existing Fortran code for 
periodic structure, and the expected advantages of the new code are as 
follows:

   - A more package flexible design provides a common framework for 
     implementation of several different SCFT solvers that are designed 
     for different geometries or that use different algorithms.

   - A more general description of polymer topology allows simulations 
     of mixtures containing arbitrary acyclic branched copolymers, in 
     addition to the linear copolymers and homopoylmers allowed by the 
     Fortran code.

   - The object oriented design will facilitate analysis of phase 
     coexistence allowing creation of several independent objects to 
     represent different phases. 

   - Adoption of C++ will simplify implementation and maintenance of 
     variants that use graphical process units (GPUs) to accelerate core 
     calculations.

Currently, the code contains:

   - A complete one-dimensional finite difference implementation for 
     studying problems that involve only a single spatial coordinate 
     in Cartesian, cylindrical or spherical coordinates (i.e., brushes, 
     interfaces, and cylindrical or circular micelles). 

   - A nearly complete pseudo-spectral implementation for periodic
     structures similar to that provided by the Fortran PSCF program.

A GPU accelerated code for periodic microstructure has been developed,
but not yet integrated into this repository.
