PSCF is a library of C++ classes and programs for solving the 
Edwards-Helfand self-consistent for polymer liquids. It is still under 
development, but is intended to eventually replace the existing Fortran 
program of the same name.  When complete, the package will contain a 
pseudo-spectral implementation for periodic structures, analagous to 
the existing Fortran code, as well as specialized implementations for 
other geometries and boundary conditons. 

Currently, the only part of the code that is fully functional is a 
one-dimensional finite difference implementation for studying problems 
that involve only a single spatial coordinate in Cartesian, cylindrical 
or spherical coordinates (i.e., brushes, interfaces, and cylindrical or 
circular micelles). 

Some differences in design relative to the existing Fortran code for 
periodic structure, and the expected advantages of the new code are 
as follows:

- A more flexible design that allow implementation of several different 
SCFT solvers that are designed for use in different geometries or that
are based on different algorithms, within the same framework. 

- A description of polymer topology that allows simulation of mixtures 
containing arbitrarily complex acyclic branched block copolymers and 
homopolymers, in addition to the linear chains allowed by the existing 
code.  (This is completed).

- The transition from Fortran 90 to a new design in object oriented C++ 
will facilitate design of simulations of phase coexistence, by allowing 
the creation of several independent objects to model different phases. 
The design of the fortran PSCF program was never intended to allow this.

- The adoption of C++ will simplify implementation and maintenance of 
specialized code to use graphical process units (GPUs) to accelerate 
core calculations, since kernel code for GPUs is usually written in a 
variant of C/C++.
