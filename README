PSCF++ is a library of C++ classes and programs for solving the 
Edwards-Helfand self-consistent field theory for polymer liquids. 
PSCF++ is still under development, but is intended to replace and
signficantly extend the existing PSCF Fortran program, which was
designed for problems involving periodic microstructures.

Differences from the existing PSCF Fortran code and expected
advantages of the new code include:

   - PSCF++ is desigend to allow implementation several different SCFT 
     solvers for use with different geometries, algorithms or hardware.

   - PSCF++ allows simulations of mixtures containing arbitrary acyclic 
     branched copolymers, in addition to the linear block copolymers and 
     homopolymers allowed by Fortran PSCF code.

   - An object oriented design allows creation of independent objects
     to represent different phases, which will facilitate analysis of 
     phase coexistence.

   - Adoption of C/C++ has simplified implementation of solver that
     uses graphical process units (GPUs) to accelerate performance.

Currently, the package contains the following types of SCFT solvers:

   - A one-dimensional finite difference solver for problems that involve 
     only a single spatial coordinate in Cartesian, cylindrical or spherical 
     coordinates.

   - A CPU-based pseudo-spectral solver for spatially periodic structures, 
     which is similar in most respects to the Fortran PSCF program. 

   - A GPU accelerated pseudo-spectral solver for period structures. 

The one-dimensional finite different solver is useful for treating problems
involving brushes, flat or curved interfaces, and cylindrical or spherical
micelles, and is being used for these purposes.

The CPU based pseudo-spectral solver for periodic microstructures now has
most of the capabilities of the Fortran PSCF code but still lacks a few 
features. Missing features that we plan to add over the next few months
include the "sweep" continuation feature and ability to simulate 
point-particle solvents.  The PSCF++ pseudo-spectral solver can read and
write the field file formats used by the PSCF fortran code, and provides 
very similar perfomance.

The GPU-accelerated pseudo-spectral solver for periodic structures is the 
least mature program within the package. Unlike the corresponding CPU
pseudo-spectral solver, this GPU solver does yet contain code to impose a 
specified space group symmetry upon the solution.
