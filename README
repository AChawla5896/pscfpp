PSCF++ is a library of C++ classes and programs for solving the 
Edwards-Helfand self-consistent field theory for polymer liquids. 
PSCF++ is still under development, but is intended to eventually replace 
the existing PSCF Fortran program.  When complete, the package will 
contain a pseudo-spectral implementation for periodic structures, 
analagous to that provided by the existing Fortran code, as well as 
specialized implementations for other geometries and boundary conditons. 

Some differences from the existing PSCF Fortran code and expected
advantages of the new code include:

   - A more flexible design provides a common framework for 
     implementation of several different SCFT solvers that are 
     intended for different geometries or that use different 
     algorithms.

   - A more general description of polymer topology allows simulations 
     of mixtures containing arbitrary acyclic branched copolymers, in 
     addition to the linear copolymers and homopolymers allowed by the 
     existing Fortran code.

   - An object oriented design will facilitate analysis of phase 
     coexistence, by allowing creation of several independent objects 
     to represent different phases. 

   - Adoption of C++ will simplify implementation and maintenance of 
     variants that use graphical process units (GPUs) to accelerate 
     core calculations.

Currently, the code contains:

   - A complete one-dimensional finite difference implementation for 
     studying problems that involve only a single spatial coordinate 
     in Cartesian, cylindrical or spherical coordinates (i.e., brushes, 
     interfaces, and cylindrical or circular micelles). 

   - A nearly complete pseudo-spectral implementation for periodic
     structures similar to that provided by the Fortran PSCF program.

A GPU accelerated code for periodic microstructure has also been 
developed, but has not yet been integrated into this git repository.
