The src/pscf directory contains source files in namespace Pscf that can be 
used in several different implementations of self-consistent field theory. 

Subdirectories:

   chem/        - classes that describe species and chemical structure
   inter/       - classes that model interaction (excess) free energy models
   solvers/     - class templates for MDE solvers for blocks, polymers, etc.
   homogeneous/ - classes that model a spatially homogeneous mixture
   math/        - mathematical utilities

All classes in directory homogeneous are defined in a nested namespace 
Pscf::Homogeneous
