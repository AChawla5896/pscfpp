To get a minimally functional Basis class template:

1) Write a makeBasis function that works only for groupName == 'I',
i.e., no symmetry. This should simply makes a star for each nonzero
vector k with k[3] >= 0, listed in the order they would be listed in 
the 1D representation of the real-to-complex Fourier grid. Test this
first for the 1D case, Basis<1>.

2) Write conversion functions (basis-to-DFT and DFT-to-basis), which 
should be written so as to work with any space group.
