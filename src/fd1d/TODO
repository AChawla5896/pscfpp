Todo for 1D finite difference code:

1) Allow for different geometrical modes (planar, cylindrical, or spherical). 
This should be specified by the Domain object, and subobjects should have access 
to this mode.

2) Because some calculations require integration and/or averaging with respect 
to space, we need generic functions to complete this operation, perhaps with a 
geometryMode flag to choose coordinate system. 

3) Allow for different ensembles (canonical vs. grand), specified independently
for each species.

4) Write code to calculate species chemical potentials and/or species volume 
fractions, and total free energy densities.
