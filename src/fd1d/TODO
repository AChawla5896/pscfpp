Todo for 1D finite difference code:

1) Test propagator and spatialAverage code for cylindrical mode.

2) Test residual and NrIterator code for spherical and cylindrical modes.

3) Test all computations in grand-canonical ensemble (canonical vs. grand).

4) Write code to calculate total Helmholtz free energy and pressure.
