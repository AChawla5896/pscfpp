Todo for 1D finite difference code:

1) Test propagator and spatialAverage code for spherical and cylindrical modes.

2) Allow for different ensembles (canonical vs. grand), specified independently
for each species.

3) Write code to calculate species chemical potentials and/or species volume 
fractions, and total free energy densities.
