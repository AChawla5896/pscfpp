Todo for 1D finite difference code:

1) Test code to calculate Helmholtz free energy and pressure.

2) Test code to subtract homogeneous reference system

3) Add sweep feature.

4) Test propagator, spatialAverage, and iterator for cylindrical mode.

5) Add system default ensemble and species ensemble to readParameters

6) Test grand-canonical ensemble (canonical vs. grand).
