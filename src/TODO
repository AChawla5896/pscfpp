1) For the 1D finite difference code

   TODO:
   - Add point-like solvents
   - Write more and/or more flexible sweep classes
   - Add an iterator factory
   - Write an Anderson Mixing iterator

2) For the pseudo-spectral code for 1D, 2D or 3D in
   directory pssp:

   - Test FFT wrapper and solvers in 2D and 3D

   - Write a simple mixing iterator for 1D crystal with no imposed
     symmetry, generalize to Anderson mixing.

   - Develop an interface to Basis, to allow development of a
     simple iterator with an imposed symmetry.

   template <int D>
   System<D> {
      Mixture<D>
      Interaction
      UnitCell<D>
      Mesh<D>
      SpaceGroup<D>
      Basis<D>
      wFields
      cFields
      Iterator
   }


   - Add general code for symmetry adapted basis functions.

   - Add stress calculators.
