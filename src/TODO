1) For the 1D finite difference code

   - Finish code to evaluate pressure
   - Write an Anderson Mixing iterator
   - Write code to compute Flory-Huggins properties
   - Write code to compute excess quantities for micelles

2) Build a pseudospectral code for periodic functions.
   Use directory pssp, namespace PsSp

   Develop class templates that allow compilation of 
   programs for spatial dimension D = 1, 2, or 3.

   template <int D>
   System<D> {
      Mixture<D>
      Interaction
      UnitCell<D>
      Mesh<D>
      SpaceGroup<D>
      Basis<D>
      wFields
      cFields
      Iterator
   }

   Next:

       Write wrapper code for FFTW
       Finish interface for Basis
       Write an explicit specialization Basis<1> of Basis for D=1
       Write pseudo-spectral Propagator and Block classes
       Start with PicardIterator and/or NrIterator

       Provide functions to convert between FFT and FBZ vectors.


4) Add AndersonIterator, perhaps an approximate NR iterator

5) Add general code for symmetry adapted basis functions.

6) Add stress calculators.
