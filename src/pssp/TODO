TODO (for pssp pseudospectral CPU code)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
class Pscf::UnitCell:

   - Revert overloaded >> and << operators for a UnitCell to original
     compact format, which is needed for use in C++ param file format.

   - See pscf/crystal/TODO for other requested changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
class Pscf::Pssp::Basis:

   - Add code to read in a space group description from a file, given
     a file name in the parameter file. One way to do this would be 
     to have interpret the string passed to Basis:makeBasis as a file
     name if it is anything other than "I".

   - See pssp/basis/TODO for less urgent changes (assigned to Dave)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unit Tests:

   - Clean up unit test in src/pssp/tests. 

      - Add unit tests of regression (i.e., comparison to Fortran) for 
        several classic phases, e.g., lamellar, hex and bcc. Examples 
        should include some non centro-symmetric space groups. Current
        tests seem to yield underflow for errors - something looks wrong.

      - Add unit tests of round trips between field file formats, using 
        files generated by Fortran PSCF when possible. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
class System: (assigned to Dave)

   - Think about how to move more code implementation out of the System
     class, or out of the System::readCommands function. Targets for moving:
 
         - Field file i/o functions (including file open/close)
         - Field file conversion functions (including file open/close)
         - Iteration including opening and reading of input file

     Possibility: Add a new FieldIo class or header to implement all of
     these.
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Later:

   - Add point solvents.

   - Add sweep functionality.
