TODO (for pssp pseudospectral code)

   - Create new functions in UnitCell, named readHeader and writeHeader,
     to read and write UnitCell data in the format used by Fortran code
     as a header for the field formats. Call these functions (rather 
     than overloaded >> and << operators) in the functions that read and
     write these file formats.

   - Revert overloaded >> and << operators for a UnitCell to original
     compact format, which is needed for use in C++ param file format.

   - Create or modify Kgrid and symmetry adapted basis function field file 
     formats to allow data interchange with Fortran code. Check by comparing
     files and source code whether current conventions used in C++ Basis
     class and those used in the Fortran code are identical for noncentrosymmetric
     groups (They should already be the same for groups that have inversion
     symmetry, but check this while you are at it). 

   - Clean up unit test in src/pssp/tests. Add unit tests of regression 
     (i.e., comparison to Fortran) for several classic phases, e.g., lam, 
     hex and bcc. Ideally, these should use symmetry adapted basis function
     file format as an input.

   - Add code to read in a space group description from a file, given a
     file name in the parameter file.

   Later:

   - Add point solvents.

   - Add sweep functionality.
