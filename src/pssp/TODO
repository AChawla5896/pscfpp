TODO (for pssp pseudospectral CPU code)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
class Pscf::UnitCell: (assigned to Anshul)

   - See pscf/crystal/TODO 

   - Work on this in a separate branch, merge into your own master
     only when done and tested, then retest in master, and finally
     send a pull request.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
class Pscf::Pssp::Basis: (assigned to Dave)

   - See pssp/basis/TODO 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
class System reorganization: (assigned to Dave, lower priority)

   - Finish testing FieldIo class and replace member functions of 
     System by calls to corresponding functions of FieldIo.

   - Create class FieldConverter that contains member functions to convert
     between formats. Test and replace conversion functions that are
     now in Basis by these functions. This will allow a smaller Basis 
     class to be moved to Pscf namespace, so that it can be used by 
     the GPU code. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Later (for CPU code alone)

   - Add point solvents.

   - Add sweep functionality.
