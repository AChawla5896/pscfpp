TODO (for pssp pseudospectral code)

   - Create new functions in UnitCell, named readHeader and writeHeader,
     to read and write UnitCell data in the format used by Fortran code
     as a header for the field formats. Call these functions (rather 
     than overloaded >> and << operators) in the functions that read and
     write these file formats.

   - Revert overloaded >> and << operators for a UnitCell to original
     compact format, which is needed for use in C++ param file format.

   - Create or modify symmetry adapted basis function and k-grid field file 
     formats to allow data interchange with Fortran code. If necessary, 
     modify Basis class to make sure it uses the same convention as the
     Fortran code for basis functions associated with pairs of open 
     stars with non-centrosymmetric groups. 

   - Clean up unit test in src/pssp/tests. Add unit tests of regression 
     (i.e., comparison to Fortran) for several classic phases, e.g., 
     lamellar, hex and bcc. Examples should include some with space
     groups that are non centro-symmetric. 

   - Add code to read in a space group description from a file, given a
     file name in the parameter file.

   Later:

   - Add point solvents.

   - Add sweep functionality.
