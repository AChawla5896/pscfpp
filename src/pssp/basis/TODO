TODO (Basis class):

1) Possibility: Add a partnerId to Basis::Wave. Once you've identified 
   the partner, why not keep track of it?

2) Add code to read a space group from a file.

3) Test Basis code with more varied groups:

   Examples: 2D Square, 
             2D Square centered (has translations and cancellations)
             2D 4 fold axis (non-centrosymmetric)
             3D (111 3 fold axis) (non-centrosymmetric)
             3D cubic BCC (has translations and cancellations)

   Make sure to test with even and odd mesh dimension elements

4) In function that converts from rGrid to symmetry adapted basis,
   add check that coefficients of components within a start have
   the same magnitude and appropriate phase relationships. Also
   check that cancelled stars have zero components. The tolerance 
   could be passed to function as a parameter with a default value.

5) Move computation of dEigen for one vector to a private function, 
   call this in makeStars() and udpate(). Alternative: Make this 
   a public member of UnitCell, giving functions ksq() and dksq().
   Unit tests to test computation of dEigen member of each vector.
   makeStars() function. Test special cases for which answer can be
   worked out analytically.

5) Possibility: Convert TWave::phase to a Rational value. Build 
   in treatment of corresponding coefficient for special cases of
   phase = 0, phase = +- 1/2, phase = +- 1/4.
