To get a minimally functional Basis class template:

1) Remove separate (public!) array containing dkSq (it is now a member
a of Basis::Star).

2) Add code to compute dkSq member of each Star.

3) Add code to compute "implicit" member for each wave.

4) Add code to allow wavevectors to be identitified by dft indices,
   without assumptions about ordering.

5) Adapt conversion functions (basis-to-DFT and DFT-to-basis) as needed 
to work with updated data structures. Test these functions.

6) Add code to identify cancelled stars (not necessary for identity group).
