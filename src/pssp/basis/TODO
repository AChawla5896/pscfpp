TODO (Basis class):

0) More tests: Basis::isValid() function and unit tests that call it. 

1) Test code to compute dEigen member of each Star to makeStars() function.

2) Add code to Basis::makeStars to identify cancelled stars (not necessary 
for tests with identity group).

3) Add code to Basis::makeStars to compute coeff correctly from operation 
of the space group (not necessary for identity group).

4) Test basis code with groups other than the identity.

5) Add code to read a space group from a file, given space group name. 

6) Question: Should accessors for stars and waves return const references, 
to prohibit code outside the class from modifying these objects?
