TODO (Basis class):

1) Add Basis::isValid() function and unit tests that call it. 

2) Test code to compute dEigen member of each Star to makeStars() function.

3) Test basis code with groups other than the identity.

4) Add code to read a space group from a file, given space group name. 

5) Question: Should accessors for stars and waves return const references, 
to prohibit code outside the class from modifying these objects?
