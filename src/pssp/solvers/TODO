1) Check if work arrays q1, q2, q1p, q2p are necessary, or if you could 
have used work arrays qf_, qr_, qr2_, qk_ etc. defined for other purposes.
Use existing work arrays when possible. 

2) If these additional arrays are needed, add trailing _ to all names, 
giving q1_, s2_, q1p_, etc., using convention for private member variables.

3) Change name dGsq to dGsq_, for the same reason.

4) Move calculation of dGsq_ into a private function computedGsq().
Rationale: This is a somewhat involved calculation that can be encapsulated
into a separate function. This would keep ep the computeStress() function 
shorter and more readable. It would also make it easy to move the 
computedGsq() function into the setupUnitCell function, which might make
sense. 

5) Let's talk about whether the current implementation of computeStress()
is taking into account the multiplicity of all boundary points correctly.
I suspect it is not, but we should think and discuss.
