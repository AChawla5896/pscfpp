This directory contains code specific to a pseudo-spectral implementation 
of SCFT for periodic structures. The code is based on algorithms similar 
to those used in the original fortran PSCF code. 

This C++ code, unlike the fortran code, requires the user to invoke different
executables for problems involving structures that are periodic in different
numbers of dimensions.  The main executables for 1, 2 and 3 dimensionally
periodic structures are named pscf_ps1d, and pscf_ps2d and pscf_ps3d, 
respectively.  Examples of the usage of this code are provided in the 
directory examples/pssp/diblock directory. 

The command line usage for doing a 3D SCFT calculation (e.g., the one in the 
examples/pssp/diblock/bcc) is to invoke

     pscf_ps3d -p param -c command

where param is the name of a parameter file and command is the name of a 
command file.
