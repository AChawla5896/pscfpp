TODO (pspg GPU code):

Short term (assigned primarily to Anshul)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Restore ability to read symmetry adapted files (without necessarily
   imposing symmetry during iteration). 

2) Restore iteration with imposed symmetry and output in symmetry adapted 
   format.

3) Try to implement suppression of implicit instantiation and compilation 
   of explicit instances of templates in pspg (as done elsewhere), to allow 
   more code to be compiled separately. This uses the C+11 extern syntax 
   to suppress implicit instantiation, and is possible only if the cuda 
   compiler recognizes this syntax.

4) Complete doxygen documenttion for all classes, functions and parameters 
   in src/pspg.

5) Move Pspg::WaveList class to directory solvers/. It's essentially a 
   utility that is used by the solvers, and doesn't need its own 
   directory.

Longer term  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Write unit tests or other self-contained, self-validating tests of the 
   GPU code and put them in the repository. 

3) Add sweep functionality 

4) Add point solvents
