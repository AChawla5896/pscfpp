TODO (pspg GPU code):

Short term (assigned primarily to Anshul)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Add ability to read symmetry adapted files (without necessarily
   imposing symmetry during iteration). 

2) Add an iterator with imposed symmetry and output in symmetry adapted 
   format.

3) Complete doxygen documenttion for all classes, functions and parameters 
   in src/pspg.

4) Move Pspg::WaveList class to directory solvers/. It's essentially a 
   utility that is used by the solvers, and doesn't need its own 
   directory.

Longer term  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Write unit tests or other self-contained, self-validating tests of 
   the GPU classes and put them in the repository. 

2) Add sweep functionality 

3) Add point solvents
