TODO (pspg GPU code):

Short term (clean up):
----------------------

1) Add explicit specializations of BatchFFT for D=1 and D=2, or rewrite as
   a template to enable compilation of 2D and 3D code. Then add 2D and 3D 
   executable names to variable PSCF_PG_EXE in makefile.

2) Change inclusion of "device_functions.h" to appropriate public file to
   suppress warnings from Cuda compiler.

3) Move WaveList class to directory solvers. It's essentially a utility that
   is used by the solvers, and doesn't need its own directory.

4) Figure out how to remove getopt/ from the public repository while retaining
   the ability for GK to link to a local copy on his laptop, perhaps by keeping
   that directory in the copy on his laptop and privately changing a few lines
   in source and source.mk files in his copy. 

5) Try to implement suppression of implicit instantiation and compilation of
   explicit instances of templates in pspg (as done elsewhere), to allow more
   code to be compiled separately. This uses the C+11 extern syntax to suppress
   implicit instantiation. 

Longer term:
------------

1) Restore ability to read symmetry adapted files.

2) Restore iteration with imposed symmetry and output in symmetry adapted format.

3) Add sweep functionality and point solvent
