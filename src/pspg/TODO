TODO (pspg GPU code):

Short term 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Complete doxygen documentation for all classes, functions and parameters 
   in src/pspg.

2) Move Pspg::WaveList class to directory solvers/. It's essentially a 
   utility that is used by the solvers, and doesn't need its own 
   directory.

3) Add an iterator with imposed symmetry and output in symmetry adapted 
   format.

Longer term  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Write unit tests or other self-contained, self-validating tests of the 
   GPU classes and put them in the repository. 

2) Add sweep functionality 

3) Add point solvents
